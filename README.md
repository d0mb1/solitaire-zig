# ---SOLITAIRE---

For running this game you'll need to have a nerd font installed
and set up in your terminal. If you're using windows you'll also need to
run "chcp 65001" command to enable unicode in your terminal.
Also for some reason it only works when using the Command Prompt
and not Windows PowerShell. Why? IDK. Maybe cuz Windows is shit.
Haven't tried any other Windows shell.
